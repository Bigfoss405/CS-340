# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I keep things simple: use clear variable names, comment my code, and separate logic into functions or modules. In Project One, the CRUD module handled all the database work. That made it easy to plug into the dashboard in Project Two without changing much. It saved time and made testing easier. I could reuse this module in any project that needs to connect to MongoDB.


# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I break the problem down into smaller steps. For the dashboard, I figured out what the client needed, then wrote the queries, built the widgets, and connected them. This project was practical, it felt like something real companies would use. In the future, Iâ€™d keep using that step-by-step approach and reuse working parts like the CRUD module.

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists solve problems with code. In this case, I helped a rescue group use data to find the right dogs for training. It matters because better tools mean faster decisions, and that can make a real difference.
